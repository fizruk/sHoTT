# sHoTT

This is a formalisation library for simplicial Homotopy Type Theory (sHoTT).

The formalisations are implemented using `rzk`, an experimental proof assistant for a variant of type theory with shapes strongly based on Riehl and Shulman's «Type Theory for Synthetic ∞-categories» ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07442](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07442)).
